            question="Are you licensed ?"
            answer="Our professionals are licensed and insured"

          <Questions
            question="What Is Your 100% Satisfaction Guarentee? "
            answer="We want you to love the results. However, if you're not completely happy, give us a call within 24 hours and we'll come back to fix any errors absolutely free."
          />

          <Questions
            question="What Do You Do With The Grass Clippings?"
            answer="Once the grass is cut, we immediately turn them into mulch. This will help to keep your grass healthy, cut down the cost of buying mulch from the store, and is less expensive than to bag and dispose of them."
          />
          <Questions
            question="Are The Chemicals From The Lawn Care Dangerous To My Kids Or Pets?"
            answer="If your lawn has been treated with chemicals within the last 24 hours, it's recommended to keep pets and people off the grass. 24 hours is usually enough time to be safe, but always ask your professional how long you should stay off your lawn each time chemicals are applied."
          />

          <Questions
            question="Will You Always Send The Same Professional?"
            answer="There is value in having the same professional working on your property due to the trust that is built and them knowing the specific needs of your lawn. While we'll try to send the same professionals to your property each time, there are times in which that isn't possible."
          />

          <Questions
            question="Do I Have To Be At Home During My Service?"
            answer="You don't need to be at home while your lawn is being serviced. However, we do ask that we have access to the area you need serviced, and that any pets are kept either indoors or in a contained area."
